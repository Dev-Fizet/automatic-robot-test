This is my firt edit from Git from my Virtual Machine:D 1

Well  in this momemt im going to check How can i clone de last version 2 

For be honest i am very happy to know this new for for track my version programa 3


Well ,i am learning about git , and i can say that it is very interesting ,so

for use firsly we need to use 

git add ==> This command works for add the new file that i modified

git commit -m "Write the modification" ==> This command it is evident

git push  ==> This command it is for me the most interestig because ,with
them we can upload the information at the cloud

git clone ==> It is for clone a repositoy like http....

git pull ==> It is a command for request the new version that stock in the
cloud ,in our case in Git Hub


Furthermore for make possible the command "git push" we need entry at the
web GitHub to make a Token speacial for make possible this event
